# CI7FinalProject
This program was designed and created to calculate the different travel options for a sales team from four different cities. In the program, it will calculate and display different route options based on user selection. Depending on the options the user selects, the program will calculate and display different routes, alternative paths, and/or the cheapest round trip route in order to let the user travel efficiently.
